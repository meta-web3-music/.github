# What is it?

OCTAV3 is a decentralized music streaming platform that connects artists, listeners and advertisers. We are building a web3 enabled ad engine to create a fairer relationship between all three stakeholders.

# How it’s made

Built with Zora, Polygon and nft.storage (IPFS):

- We used Zora’s contracts to allow artists to mint/transfer a song NFT and an advertisement NFT.
- All contracts are deployed on Polygon’s test network, Mumbai.
- All the data (i.e ad images) and metadata is stored and queryable on IPFS through nft.storage.
- Next.js (React) for the client.
- TailwindCSS and Ant Design was used for the front-end styling.
- Ether.js to allow the front-end to interact with the smart contracts.
